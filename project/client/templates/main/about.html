    <h1>What's a Fermi question?</h1>
    <hr><br>
    Enrico Fermi, the famous italian physicist who was part of the Manhatten project, was well known for his
    talent to give very good estimates for difficult questions on the basis of only a few commonly known facts.
    Such questions are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi questions</a>.
